# Checkers
This was my first java project it is a simple game of Checkers with a Bot and a very basic GUI.

## File Description 
As this was my first project in Java I did not use github and the file structure is not ideal.

## Bot
In the program you play againest a bot which is using a  Min/Max algorithm to decide the best move

## How to Play

The current turn is indicated by the color of the piece in the top left corner. When it is your turn click on a piece, a green circle will
indicate the piece you have choosen, then proceed to click on a square you wish to move the piece. NB you must click on the screen to make the computer make his turn (annoying I know).
